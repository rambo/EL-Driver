# EL driver

Trying to build as small as possible (and relatively efficiente) EL driver
for small panels/wires for wearable applications.

Currently looking at using Micrel ICs

# TODO

Make a separate eagle library for the ICs (now they're in my personal library that 
has a lot of unneccessary cruft) and push it here.
